# RuneYoutubeAddon
YouTube addon for RuneAudio

This adds a youtube button to the Playlist screen of the rune audio player

Simply paste a youtube video URL or a youtube playlist URL, wait for them to download, and these songs will be added to your playlist.


##Please note:
This requires the MPM Upgrade to be installed first
Its a good idea to store to expand the filesystem or you'll only be able to store 10 songs...
